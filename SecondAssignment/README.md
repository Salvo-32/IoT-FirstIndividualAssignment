# IoT Second individual assignment
The goal of this assignment is to deploy a wireless sensor network, which consists of multiple MCUs, by using 802.15.4 mesh network technologies and 6LoWPAN  protocols, and meanwhile to evaluate the performance of the whole wireless system.

## How do you measure the performance of the system
Each of the following points measure the performance of the whole IoT system in term of Network performance and Energy efficiency as the number of wireless node increase and their physical locations vary. 
### 5 wireless nodes as in series network topology 
#### Network performance

#### Energy consumption

### 5 wireless nodes as mesh network topology 
#### Network performance

#### Energy consumption

### 10 wireless nodes as in-series network topology 
#### Network performance

#### Energy consumption

### 10 wireless nodes as mesh network topology
#### Network performance

#### Energy consumption

### Conclusion
