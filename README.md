## IoT-Lab Quotation
Both the second and third assignments involve the use of FIT IoT-LAB: 
> an accurate and efficient scientific tool, built to help and foster the design, development, tuning, and experimentation of large scale IoT applications

It is employed to prove the ability of scaling the first individual assignment idea using a bigger number of **real** boards, and at the same time to test the performance.
